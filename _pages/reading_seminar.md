title: Reading Seminars
description: Fall 2022 under the guidance of Prof. Song Sun, we organize a reading seminar on complex differential geometry. This semester we don't have a presecribed topic to study rather than participants are free to give talks from their own tastes. You can sign up for a talk using this google sheet. Song is willing to provide interesting topics and related references, so if you want to find a topic to study and give a talk on the seminar, feel free to reach out to Song for help.
