title: Reading Seminars
description: Fall 2022 under the guidance of Prof. Song Sun, we organize a reading seminar on complex differential geometry. This semester we don't have a presecribed topic to study rather than participants are free to give talks from their own tastes. You can sign up for a talk using this google sheet. Song is willing to provide interesting topics and related references, so if you want to find a topic to study and give a talk on the seminar, feel free to reach out to Song for help.

I'm a GSI for Math 16A (Analytic Geometry and Calculus) Fall 2022. The office hours are Thursday 10:00-11:59 am.


I taught Math 54 (Linear Algebra) and Math 53 (Multivariable Calculus) in the past several years.
